    <h1>Tigers</h1>
    <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is a large cat and a member of the<br>
        genus Panthera native to Asia. It has a powerful, muscular body with a large head and paws,<br>
        a long tail and orange fur with black, mostly vertical stripes. It is traditionally<br>
        classified into nine recent subspecies, though some recognise only two subspecies,<br>
        mainland Asian tigers and the island tigers of the Sunda Islands.

    <h1>Lion</h1>
    <p>
        he lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Sub-Saharan Africa and India.<br>
        It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft<br>
        at the tip of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and<br>
        have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride<br>
        consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually<br>
        hunt together, preying mostly on medium-sized and large ungulates. The lion is an apex <br>
        and keystone predator.

        mostly solitary and nocturnal birds of prey typified by an upright stance, a large, broad head, binocular<br>
        vision, binaural hearing, sharp talons, and feathers adapted for silent flight. Exceptions include<br>

    <p>
        Sea lions are pinnipeds characterized by external ear flaps, long foreflippers, the ability to walk on all<br>
        fours, short and thick hair, and a big chest and belly. Together with the fur seals, they make up the <br>
        family Otariidae, eared seals. The sea lions have six extant and one extinct species (the Japanese sea lion)<br>
        in five genera. Their range extends from the subarctic to tropical waters of the global ocean in both the <br>
        Northern and Southern Hemispheres, with the notable exception of the northern Atlantic Ocean.[1]
