    <p>
    The tiger (Panthera tigris) is a large cat and a member of the genus Panthera native to Asia. It has a powerful,<br>
    muscular body with a large head and paws, a long tail and orange fur with black, mostly vertical stripes.<br>
    It is traditionally classified into nine recent subspecies, though some recognise only two subspecies,<br>
    mainland Asian tigers and the island tigers of the Sunda Islands.
