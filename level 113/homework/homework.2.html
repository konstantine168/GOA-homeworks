    <p>
        The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Sub-Saharan Africa and India.<br>
        It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the<br>
        tip of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent<br>
        mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males,<br>
        related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on medium-sized<br>
        and large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator.
