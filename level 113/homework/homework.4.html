    <p>
    A piano is a keyboard instrument that produces sound when its keys are depressed, activating an action mechanism<br>
    where hammers strike strings. Modern pianos have a row of 88 black and white keys, tuned to a chromatic scale<br>
    in equal temperament. A musician who specializes in piano is called a pianist.
