    <p>
    The drum is a member of the percussion group of musical instruments. In the Hornbostelâ€“Sachs classification system,<br>
    it is a membranophone.[1] Drums consist of at least one membrane, called a drumhead or drum skin, that is<br>
    stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with the player's hands, or with a percussion mallet,<br>
    to produce sound. There is usually a resonant head on the underside of the drum. Other techniques have<br>
    been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the thumb roll. Drums are the world's oldest and most<br>
    ubiquitous musical instruments, and the basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of<br>
    years.[1]
