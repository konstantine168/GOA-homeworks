<h1>CAPYBARA</h1>
<h2>emytology</h2>
</head>
<body>
<p>Its common name is derived from Tupi ka'apiûara, a complex agglutination of kaá (leaf) + píi (slender) + ú (eat) +<br>
ara (a suffix for agent nouns), meaning "one who eats slender leaves", or "grass-eater".[4] The genus name,<br>
hydrochoerus, comes from Greek ὕδωρ (hydor "water") and χοῖρος (choiros "pig, hog") and the species name,
hydrochaeris, comes from Greek ὕδωρ (hydor "water") and χαίρω (chairo "feel happy, enjoy").[5][6]<br></p>

<p>Though quite agile on land, capybaras are equally at home in the water. They are excellent swimmers, and can<br>
remain completely submerged for up to five minutes,[14] an ability they use to evade predators. Capybaras can sleep in water, keeping only their noses<br>
out.As temperatures increase during the day, they wallow in water and then graze during the late afternoon and early evening.[7] They also spend time<br>
wallowing in mud.[18] They rest around midnight and then continue to graze before dawn.[7]<br></p>
