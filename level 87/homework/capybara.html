    <h2>Info</h2>
    <p>
        The capybara[a] or greater capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris)<br>
        is the largest living rodent,[2] native to South America.<br>
        It is a member of the genus Hydrochoerus.<br>
        The only other extant member is the lesser capybara (Hydrochoerus isthmius).<br>
        Its close relatives include guinea pigs and rock cavies,<br>
        and it is more distantly related to the agouti, the chinchilla,<br>
        and the nutria. The capybara inhabits savannas and dense forests,<br>
        and lives near bodies of water.<br>
        It is a highly social species and can be found in groups as large as 100 individuals,<br>
        but usually live in groups of 10â€“20 individuals.<br>
        The capybara is hunted for its meat and hide and also for grease from its thick fatty skin.[3]
