        Apple is a company made by "Apple"<br>
        it is pure perfection!<br>
        Apple Inc. is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered and incorporated in Cupertino, California, in Silicon Valley. It is<br>
        best known for its consumer electronics, software, and services. Founded in 1976 as Apple Computer Company by Steve Jobs,<br>
        Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, the company was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. the following year. It was renamed Apple Inc. in 2007<br>
        as the company had expanded its focus from computers to consumer electronics. Apple is the largest technology company by revenue, with US$391.04 billion in 2024.<br>
        The company was founded to produce and market Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Its second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller<br>
        as one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first computers<br>
        to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By 1985, internal company problems led to Jobs leaving to form NeXT, Inc., and Wozniak<br>
        withdrawing to other ventures; John Sculley served as long-time CEO for over a decade. In the 1990s, Apple lost considerable market<br>
        share in the personal computer industry to the lower-priced Wintel duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on<br>
        Intel-powered PC clones. In 1997, Apple was weeks away from bankruptcy. To resolve its failed operating system strategy, it bought NeXT,<br>
        effectively bringing Jobs back to the company, who guided Apple back to profitability over the next decade with the introductions of the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad<br>
        devices to critical acclaim as well as the iTunes Store, launching the "Think different" advertising campaign, and opening the Apple<br>
        Store retail chain. These moves elevated Apple to consistently be one of the world's most valuable brands since about 2010. Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons,<br>
        and died two months later; he was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.<br>
