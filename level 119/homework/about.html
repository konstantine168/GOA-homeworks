        The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a large bear native to the Arctic and nearby areas. It is closely related to the brown bear,<br>
        and the two species can interbreed. The polar bear is the largest extant species of bear and land carnivore by body mass,<br>
        with adult males weighing 300–800 kg (660–1,760 lb). The species is sexually dimorphic, as adult females are much smaller.<br>
        The polar bear is white- or yellowish-furred with black skin and a thick layer of fat. It is more slender than the brown bear,<br>
        with a narrower skull, longer neck and lower shoulder hump. Its teeth are sharper and more adapted to cutting meat. The paws <br>
        are large and allow the bear to walk on ice and paddle in the water.
