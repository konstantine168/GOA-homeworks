    <p>
        Ben 10 (retroactively known as Classic Ben 10) is an American<br>
        animated series created by Man of Action, produced by Cartoon Network Studios and distributed<br>
        by Warner Bros. Domestic Television. The series is about a 10-year-old boy named Ben Tennyson who<br>
        gets a watch-style alien device called the "Omnitrix". Attached to his wrist, it allows him to transform<br>
        into 10 different alien creatures with different abilities, allowing him to fight evil from Earth and space<br>
        with his cousin Gwen and grandfather Max. The series first aired on Cartoon Network as a sneak<br>
        peek on December 27, 2005, as part of "Sneak Peek Week", airing alongside other<br>
        shows, including My Gym Partner's a Monkey,<br>
        Robotboy and Zixx. It later became a full series airing from January 13, 2006, to April 15, 2008.<br>
